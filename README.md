# Steps To Setting Up A React App With A GitHub Repo

These steps will take you though getting a React set up with ```create-react-app```, and adding the app to a GitHub repository.

## Creating an new React App
*In The Terminal Run These Commands* 

1. Run ```create-react-app nameofthereactapp```. Name the app what ever you like.

2. ```cd nameofthereactapp```. cd into the app that was just created.

3. In the root run ```yarn install```. This will get yarn installed so you can run the build and start scripts.

4. Run ```yarn start```. This will open the app in the browser.

**If evrything is done right it should look something like this**

**Now that we have created a React App lets "wrap" it in a GitHub Repo**

## Creating a new GitHub repo and adding our app

1. Go to [GitHub](http://github.com).

2. Create a new repository with **NO** README.

3. Follow the steps under **â€¦or create a new repository on the command line**.

*Should be the first one*

**Run steps 4 - 5 in the root directory of the React App that we just created**

4. In the terminal run ```git init```.

5. **Skip adding a README**. When we ran ```create-react-app``` it added a README for us.

6. Add all of you files with ```git add .```.

7. Make your first commit to GitHub ```git commit -m "First Commit!"```.

8. Make sure you copy the ```git remote add origin``` part from the steps on GitHub. Paste them into the terminal and run it. This will link everything to your Repo.

9. Last step run ```git push -u origin master```.

**Now if we refresh the page we should see all of the files and folders in our GitHub repository**

### We now have a GitHub repository with our React App linked

**Happy Hacking!**
